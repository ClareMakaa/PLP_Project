My PLP final project - "SpendsWise: The Budget Bouncer App"

This creation is a personal expense tracking application that allows users to enter their daily expenditures, categorize them (such as groceries, entertainment, bills), establish monthly budgets, and receive alerts when surpassing predefined budget thresholds. Additionally, it will incorporate a functionality for users to access detailed expense reports and insights.
